At the recent Anniversary Open Day of the Shanghai Innovation Institute (SII), our research came to life with a simple request: "Hey BobaBot, make me a bubble tea!"

Our robotic barista, "Boba Bot," was put to the test, running non-stop for two consecutive days. It seamlessly managed the entire workflow from order-taking to task-planning and final execution, demonstrating remarkable resilience under pressure. This was more than a demo; it was a validation of our work in a live, unpredictable setting, far from the ideal conditions of a lab.

Boba Bot serves as the official real-world showcase for our [NeurIPS'25] UniDomain project. The ability of the robot to operate autonomously and consistently is powered by the core principles of our UniDomain framework, bridging the gap between theoretical research and practical, tangible application.
