Hi, I am Jintian Cai (蔡今天), a first-year PhD student at Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU) and SII, supervised by Prof. Panpan Cai. I develop robotic systems embedded with physical knowledge.

Previously, I was an autonomous driving engineer at Horizon Robotics. I received an M.A. degree in Statistics from Boston University (BU), USA, and an Honours B.Sc. degree from the University of Toronto (UofT), Canada.
